    You can now specify ``driver-notes.XXX`` values. These are useful to
    provide additional context for features with a status of ``partial``. For
    example::

        [operation.Cool_Feature]
        title=Cool Feature
        status=optional
        notes=A pretty darn cool feature.
        driver.foo=complete
        driver.bar=partial
        driver-notes.bar=Requires hardware support.
